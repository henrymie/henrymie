Hello! My name is Henry, and I am a frontend and backend developer with experience in building a variety of web and application projects. Some of apps I've created:

    Typing Master: A tool designed to enhance typing speed and accuracy.
    Nexus Games: An unblocked gaming site for schools, offering students access to fun and educational games.
    Sunset Games: Another unblocked gaming site providing diverse games for school environments.
    Nexus Proxy: A proxy site built for school use, allowing secure and filtered browsing.

I work with a wide range of technologies, including React, Unity, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, to deliver both engaging user interfaces and secure backend systems. I'm passionate about creating solutions that are both functional and user-friendly!
