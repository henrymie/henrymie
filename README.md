Hello! My name is Henry, and I am a frontend and backend developer with experience in building websites, and apps here's some examples:

    Typing Master: A fun game where you have to type as fast as you can!
    Nexus Games: An unblocked gaming site for schools, including subway surfers, minecraft and more.
    Sunset Games: Another unblocked gaming site.
    Nexus Proxy: A proxy site that can unblock any site.

I work with a wide range of technologies, including React, Unity, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, to deliver both engaging user interfaces and secure backend systems. I'm passionate about creating solutions that are both functional and user-friendly!
